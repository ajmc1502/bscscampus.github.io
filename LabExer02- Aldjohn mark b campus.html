<P><DD>There were once three brothers who were travelling along lonely winding road at twilight. In
time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim accross. However,
these brothers were learned in the magicals arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a 
bridge appeared across thr treacherous water. They were halfway accross it when they found their path 
blocke by a hooded figure. And Death spoke to them. He was angyr that he had been cheated out of 
three new victims, for travels ususally drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to 
congratualate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each earned a prize for having been 
cleaver to enough to evade him.
</P>
<P><DD>The eldest brother, who was commbative ma, asked for a wand more powerful than any in 
existence: a wand that must always wind duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who has
conquered Death! So Death crossed an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a
branch that hung there, and gave it to the eldest brother.
</P>
<P><DD>Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death
Still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the
riverbanks and gave it to the second brother, and told him that stone would have the power to bring 
back the dead.
</P>
<P><DD>And the Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother
was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he  did not trust Death. So he asked for
something that would enable hom to go forth from th place without being followed by death. And Death
most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
</P>
<P><DD>Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so,
talking with wonder of the adventure they had and admiring Death's gifts.
In due course the brothers separated, each for his own distination.
</P>
<P><DD>The first brother travelled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a
fellow wizard with whom he had quarrel.Eventually, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail
to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceed to an
inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand, he had snatched for the Death himself, and of how it
made him invincible.
</P>
<P><DD>That every night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his
bed. The thief tooked wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother throat.
</P>
<P><DD>And so death too the first brother for his own.
</P>
<P><DD>Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived aloned. Here he took 
out the stone that he had the power to recall the dead, and turned on thrice in his hand. To his amazement
and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at 
once before him.
</P>
<P><DD>Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him by a vailed. Though she had returned to the mortal
world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally, the secend brother driven mad with hopeless
longing killed himself so as truly join her.
</P>
<P><DD>But though Death searched fot the Thirs brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It
was when he had attained a great age that youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of
Invisibility and gave it to his son. And them he greeted Daeth as an old friend, and went with him gladly,
and equals, they departed this life.
